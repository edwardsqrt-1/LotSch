# LotSch
This is a simple scheduler simulation where processes are picked much like how one would win a littery, that is, each process is given a ticket number and the scheduler will choose a random number to determine which process should go next. 

## Build
Simply download main.cpp and compile it with just `g++ main.cpp -o main`. You can then execute the main file

## Notes
In case you desire to know what ancient computer I used this time, this time it was developed on Windows XP using Dev-C++!
